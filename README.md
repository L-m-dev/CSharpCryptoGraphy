RSA is an implementation of asymmetric encryption, also called public key encryption

DES â€” Data Encryption Standard is a symmetric encryption algorithm that encrypts using 56 bits of data. 
The DES algorithm was broken, and as a result, came Triple DES; which encrypted and decrypted data with three keys.
Both DES and Triple DES are not recommended in modern applications, given the advancement of computational power made in the last few decades. 

AES (Advanced encryption standard) is a successor to the DES mentioned above after it was broken.
Rather than the 56-bit key in DES, AES uses a 128, 192, or 256-bit key; making it less susceptible to brute force attacks.

AES is based on the Rigndaal cipher which is a series of encryption algorithms.

There are different modes of AES encryption with differing advantages and disadvantages. Some of the modes are:

ECB mode: Electronic Code Book mode

CBC mode: Cipher Block Chaining mode

CFB mode: Cipher Feedback mode

OFB mode: Output Feedback mode

CTR mode: Counter mode

GCM mode: Galois Counter Mode
